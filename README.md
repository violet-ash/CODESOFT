# CODESOFT
Hello folks,
Welcome to my data science intership portfolio.In this program we are going to complete the tasks given.In this repository you will find the projects completed by during the codesoft intership.
# Projects
1.Titanic Survival Detection Description: This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict survival probabilities.

2.Movie Rating Prediction with Python Description: In this project, I built a movie rating prediction system using Python. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and the development of a machine learning model to predict movie ratings.

3..Iris Flower Classification Description: The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

4.Sales Prediction using Python Description: This project focuses on predicting sales for a business. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model to forecast future sales.

5.Credit Card Fraud Detection Description: In the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, I developed a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The project addresses class imbalance, preprocesses data, and uses logistic regression for classification.
